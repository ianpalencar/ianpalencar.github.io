      <h1>Home NAS</h1>
      
      <i>The ebb and flow between networking and sneakernet continues.</i>
      
    </header>
    <p>I wanted some flexibility on storing and accessing my data. Moving USB drives from machine to machine seems so archaic with the advent of high speed networking.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="r510">R510</h2>
<p>One system that could take advantage of a 10 gigabit card was my planned file server. Starting off, I purchased a 12 drive bay R510 and ensured it contained an H200 and packed it with RAM. I bought four 8TB WD external drives and shucked them after ensuring they passed a drive test overnight. I also installed a 10 gigabit <a href="https://www.mellanox.com/related-docs/prod_adapter_cards/ConnectX-2_EN_Cards.pdf">Mellanox ConnectX® 2</a> card and used a DAC to connect to the switch. After adding a copy of TrueNAS this has become my home workhorse, and now manages serving file shares, hosting backups, and my Plex server calls it home.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I chose a 12-bay R510 with dual L5640 CPUs and 64GB of RAM to run <a href="https://www.truenas.com/">TrueNAS</a>. The hardware is certainly older now but it does well to serve files. My next machine (and pending migration to TrueNAS SCALE) is lying in wait, but that&rsquo;s for another post.</p>
<p>I also have a Mellanox Connectx-2 card installed, for a single 10Gb port. This is directly hooked into one of the ports on my switch, facilitating multiple simultaneous 1Gb links.</p>
<p>My current drive setup involves just four 8TB WD white label drives. I thoroughly tested these before shucking them, and while I&rsquo;d prefer to have the longer warranty afforded by purchasing proper drives I didn&rsquo;t want to spend the premium for them.</p>
<p>Boot drives consist of two mirrored SSDs. I started with flash drives but I ran into reliability issues, where one or the other would regularly drop out. The configuration and setup is stored directly on the pool drives, so there&rsquo;s no need for fast hardware here.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bog-standard TrueNAS installation. What more could one want? A single pool is set up between my disks and sliced as-needed for things like media and backups. VLAN trunking isn&rsquo;t fun to set up (I gave up and just used a separate NIC for certain traffic) but I&rsquo;m going to be giving that another whirl with SCALE.</p>
<h2 id="jails">Jails</h2>
<p>Just as the rest of the world moves to container orchestration, I&rsquo;ve decided to pick up jails and adopt a lot of pets as a result. They&rsquo;re fragile and even the official (at least as-listed in the UI) plugins/jails tend to break on upgrade. Looking forward to SCALE and just running containers instead.</p>
<h3 id="plex">Plex</h3>
<p>Gotta have Plex. I migrated from Google Music (where I was one of those weird people that only listened to music I uploaded or purchased via the service) so Plex was a nice spot to land with the shutdown of Google Music. I might migrate to a different solution someday but for now it&rsquo;s been a great way to consolidate my library first and play it on all my devices second.</p>
<h3 id="nextcloud">Nextcloud</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m also slowly ejecting from most public clouds for fun, and I needed a good replacement for collaborative file sharing and document editing. Nextcloud seems to hit all of that well enough!</p>
<h3 id="gitea">Gitea</h3>
<p>Forge wars aside, I ended up standing up Gitea as a way to store my own code. I&rsquo;ll hook CI up someday, but probably only after the SCALE migration.</p>
